# Using ArcGIS Collector with OpenStreetMap

## Background
Kigeme refugee camp is located in Southern Rwanda, Africa and serves over 18,000 refugees, up to 40% of which are children. Rochester Institute of Technology [visited](https://www.rit.edu/news/story.php?id=54486) the camp and collected GIS survey data using [ArcGIS Collector](http://www.esri.com/products/collector-for-arcgis) about boundaries, roads, and facilities. Access to geographic data empowers researchers, administrators, and residents to improve life in the camp, however there exists no direct way to incorporate the information gathered along with metadata into the world's largest free geographical database: OpenStreetMap.
